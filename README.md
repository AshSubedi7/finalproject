# finalproject
###This is Ashutosh Subedi's CIST 1310 System Analysis and Design Final Project

###Some requirements needed to run this program:
You will need to install python if you don't have it. Check which version of python you have, becasue soome of the commands will not work between versions. I created this in Python Version 3.8.10 so you will atleast need Python version 3. You will also need to install flask. You will download flask in a virtual envirenment. You will have to install teh virtual environment in the desired directory you have saved this repository. These are the basic things needed to run this program. Thakn you for downloading this repository Hopefully it is helpful, and usefull in whatever you are trying to accomplish.
